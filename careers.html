        <h1>Electronics Engineer</h1>
        <h2>Dirac Labs</h2>

        <h3>Start Date:</h3>
        <p>At the earliest</p>

        <h3>Location:</h3>
        <p>Bengaluru, Karnataka, India</p>

        <h3>About Dirac Labs:</h3>
        <p>Dirac Labs is revolutionizing navigation with cutting-edge technologies designed to be robust against blocking and spoofing. By integrating advanced quantum sensors with machine learning, the company accurately determines position using the Earth’s magnetic field—offering a reliable, precise, and independent positioning solution.</p>
        <p>Dirac Labs is an early-stage company emerging out of quantum sensing and nanophotonics research efforts at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (USA). It has won the prestigious US-India Endowment Fund’s award to develop quantum sensors, and is supported by Creative Destruction Labs, Emergent Ventures, and NASA.</p>

        <h3>About the Role:</h3>
        <p>You will be a part of a small, fast-paced, research-focused team developing electronics for real-time positioning and navigation systems using multi-sensor data fusion:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Design and develop electronics for quantum sensors (inertial and electromagnetic).</li>
            <li>Integrate and test performance of sensors on mobile platforms.</li>
            <li>Collaborate with quantum physicists & machine learning scientists to develop a robust hardware architecture for sensing and real-time data processing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Requirements (must haves):</h3>
